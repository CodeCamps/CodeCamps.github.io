## Who I Am

Joe Hall has been a professional software developer for more than 20 years. 
He worked as a programmer for Microsoft and IBM and was the software architect 
for a Fortune 500 bank. He was the CTO of a ticket sales and servicing company 
and he started his own consulting company in 2006.

Joe makes his living writing desktop, web, and mobile device applications for 
businesses, but game programming is his passion, and it was gaming that got 
him into programming in the first place. 

He was a member of the original Xbox team and he joined the Visual Studio 
.NET team just after the Xbox was released in 2001. Joe is the author of 
[XNA Game Studio Express: Developing Games for Windows and the Xbox 360](http://www.amazon.com/XNA-Game-Studio-Express-Developing/dp/1598633686/ref=as_li_tf_mfw?&linkCode=wey&tag=coll06-20), 
which was published in 2007. 

Joe also dabbles in sketching, cartooning, and creating 3D models. When you see 
his artistic creations, you'll understand why he makes his living as a programmer. 

He lives with his family in Alabama.

## What I Do

I teach a game programming camp every year for [Landry Academy](http://landryacademy.com/] in (Banner Elk, NC)[https://www.google.com/maps/place/Banner+Elk,+NC+28604/@36.1567804,-81.872516,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x88508d56395ba3f1:0x4d2442b0fcfa987a). 
I occasionally do the same for some local teens and tweens in [Montgomery, AL](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Montgomery,+AL/@32.343799,-86.2460375,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x888e8194b0d481f9:0x8e1b511d354285ff).

The projects that they create can be found here:

## Camps (Banner Elk, NC)

- [Camp2011]{http://camps.moreoncode.com/Camp2011/)

## Prerequisites

Students will collaborate in the design and implementation of a video game. 
From whiteboard sketch to computer screen, they will learn how to create the 
simple, easy-to-understand components of a game, and how those simpler parts 
combine to make a more-complex whole. 

They will learn about the tools that game developers use to create games, and 
how to prioritize and trim their initial design to meet a looming deadline. 

Working as a team, the students will create a working game from their concept, 
and demonstrate that game to the other campers at the end of the week. Towards 
the end of the week, students will participate in "lab time", where they are 
encouraged to identify and implement changes to the class game to put their 
own personal touches on the project. This helps ensure that the students 
understand the material that was covered well enough to venture out on their 
own. 

While there are no prerequisites for this camp, each student **MUST** bring 
their own laptop which runs some version of Windows (XP/Vista/7). A MacBook 
may be used, but it will need to have a copy of Windows running in a virtual 
machine (e.g. Parallels or VMWare Fusion) or BootCamp. 

All course materials and requisite software will be provided.

## Thanks

Thanks for stopping by. I haven't quite decided what else will live here yet. But, you can probably expect more content here soon.
